keySet only returns a set of key in your hashmap , you should iterate this key set and the get the value from the hashmap using these keys .
In your example , the type of the hashmap 's key is TypeKey , but you specified TypeValue in your generic for-loop , so it cannot be compiled. You should change it to :
If you don't require to print key value and just need the hashmap value , you can use others' suggestion .
Another question: Is this collection is zero base? I mean if it has 1 key and value will it size be 0 or 1?
The collection returned from keySet is a Set.You cannot get the value from a Set using an index , so it is not an question whether it is zero-based or one-based. If your hashmap has one key , the keySet() returned will has one entry inside , and its size is 1.
